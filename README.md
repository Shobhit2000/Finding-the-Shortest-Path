# Finding-the-Shortest-Path
This genetic algorithm based project learns to finds the shortest path from the source to the goal when there is an obstacle line in between it. Initially when we run the program we can see a lot of lines and it does not even reach to the goal but gradually it finds its path and reaches its goal and also dodges the obstacle.

The lines are displayed using the interactive window feature of the matplotlib library. The blue dot represents the source and the red dot represents the goal.
